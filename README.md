# yuruyuri-who

A program that can identify YuruYuri character(s) from an image.

Obviously, this code is written for fun. Characters are classified according to their hair color, so it is not possible to differentiate between characters like Akari and Akane. And it works well only on images from [Namori's Instagram posts](https://www.instagram.com/namoridane/).

## Dependencies

`opencv==4.7.0`

## Build

```bash
make
```

## Usage

```bash
yryr test.jpg
```
